      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Once upon a time, communication was simple. A letter, a handshake, a face-to-face conversation. But as technology grew, so did the noise. Messages got lost. Important updates drowned in a sea of junk. And opportunities? They slipped through the cracks.</p>
      <p>That's why Blink was born.</p>

      <p>We believe in clarity over chaos. Blink was designed for people who value efficiency, for those who refuse to let crucial messages go unheard. In a world overflowing with distractions, we bring focus.</p>
